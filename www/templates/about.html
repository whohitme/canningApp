        Welcome to the “Canning App”, which contains abbreviated checklists to guide you through the steps to successfully canning vegetables, fruits, meats and seafood.  These checklists will remind those who have canned before of the steps in the canning process. While these checklists serve as guides, they are not inclusive of every step in food preparation, preservation and storage; home food preservers should always follow current, tested recipes and instructions to ensure their products are safe and good quality.  Remember, if pressure canning, have gauge checked before use. For complete instructions and further details about preparing the food and the steps outlined, refer to the <a class="link" href="#" onclick="window.open('http://nchfp.uga.edu/publications/publications_usda.html', '_system', 'location=yes'); return false;">USDA Complete Guide to Home Canning</a>  or <a class="link" href="#" onclick="window.open('http://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/search/content/food%20preservation', '_system', 'location=yes'); return false;">OSU Extension Service food preservation publications.</a>

Pacific Northwest Extension publications are produced cooperatively by the three Pacific Northwest land-grant universities: Oregon State University, Washington State University, and the University of Idaho. Similar crops, climate, and topography create a natural geographic unit that crosses state lines. Since 1949, the PNW program has published more than 600 titles, preventing duplication of effort, broadening the availability of faculty specialists, and substantially reducing costs for the participating states.<br>

Published and distributed in furtherance of the Acts of Congress of May 8 and June 30, 1914, by the Oregon State University Extension Service, Washington State University Extension, University of Idaho Extension, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture cooperating.<br>
